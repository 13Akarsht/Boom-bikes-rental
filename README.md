They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.  We need to answer two questions for the company:  Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands
